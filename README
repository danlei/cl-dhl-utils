In order to use this system, a symbolic link to dhl-utils.asd must be
created under a directory included in asdf:*central-registry*. Then,
the system can be loaded:

CL-USER> (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'dhl-utils)

For running the tests, dhl-utils-test.asd must be symlinked, too.
Then, the tests can be run:

CL-USER> (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'dhl-utils)

If the tests are not run when evaluating this expression, ":force
t" should be provided when calling oos:

CL-USER> (asdf:oos 'asfd:test-op 'dhl-utils :force t)

If the OS the system is run on does not support symbolic links, the
directory containing the system should be added to
*asdf-central-registry* before loading:

CL-USER> (push "/path/to/system/" asdf:*central-registry*)

After the system has been loaded, the provided functionality is
exposed as the external symbols of package DHL-UTILS, which is aliased
to DHLU.

Some functions depend on Pascal Costanza's CLOSER-MOP and will signal
an error when called, if CLOSER-MOP was not loaded before DHL-UTILS.
